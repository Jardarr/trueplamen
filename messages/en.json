				"stanza": "&quot;Death is just the Beginning&quot;",
				"description": "It all started in 2006, in the heart of starlight night, when two man record a demo tape called &quot;Return to Death&quot; - a raw narrative using a crude drum machine, but filled with the sincerity of the participants. The demo distributed among a close circle of people involved in the black metal underground."

				"title": "Act 5.",
				"stanza": "&quot;Smoke of black souls, flame of vermilion tongues.<br />Temples are filling with ashes of the burning hearts.<br />Scars-pathways lead beyond heavenly threshold<br />The breed of another ones doomed to wanderings...&quot;",

			},
			"act6": {
				"title": "Act 6.",
				"stanza": "&quot;A song is a fire that is dangerous to joke with. Song is not a game, but a sacred act. Let in this songs chaos, the cry of a lonely soul, the boiling of dark forces - let them! For the breath of God is not in silence, but in storms.&quot;",
				"description": "The religious album &quot;Anabasis ov Spirit&quot;, consisting of seven proclamations, is the quintessence of the creators inner torments. Released in 2020 by the label &quot;Thou Shalt Kill!&quot;, it is currently the most personal act among the other works."
